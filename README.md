# CondensaCore,'an innovative YouTube Video Summarizer web app'

Led the development of 'CondensaCore,' an innovative YouTube Video Summarizer web app, as a highlight project at ConUHacks - a demanding 24-hour hackathon challenge. This tool represents a breakthrough in digital efficiency, catering to the time-sensitive needs of students and professionals alike.

CondensaCore addresses a common dilemma: the need to grasp the essence of lengthy YouTube lectures without the upfront time investment. Our solution? A user-friendly web app that swiftly generates comprehensive summaries from video links. This not only saves valuable time but also enhances learning and information retention.

Key Contributions and Technical Details:

Spearheaded the project from conception to implementation, ensuring seamless integration of front-end and back-end technologies.
Developed the front-end using React, enhanced by Bootstrap for a responsive and intuitive user interface.
Integrated OpenAI's GPT-4 API, leveraging its advanced capabilities to produce accurate and coherent summaries.
Crafted a robust back-end with Python and Flask server, incorporating the 'youtube-transcript-api 0.6.2' by Jdepoix for transcript extraction and processing.
Implemented a virtual environment to ensure a stable and isolated development space, promoting efficient project management and deployment.
This project is a testament to my ability to deliver complex, user-centric solutions under tight deadlines, demonstrating proficiency in both front-end and back-end technologies. CondensaCore stands as a prime example of my commitment to innovation and my skill in bridging the gap between technological capability and real-world utility.
